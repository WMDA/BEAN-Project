# BEAN-Project
machine learning and statistical python package for non coders based on ANACONDA
Bean libary 

Bean Libary is a Python based machine learning libary and statistical libary based on ANACONDA. 
It was started because I was getting annoyed at having to programme the same commands again to run simple things like t tests, as well as having to put blocks of code to do simple machine learning techniques such as kfold regression anaylsis.
The philosophy of the libary is all code should be done in one line, with as much flexability as possible. 

Currently a fragemented work in progress.
