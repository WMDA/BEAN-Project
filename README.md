# BEAN-Project
## Machine learning and statistical python package for non coders based on ANACONDA  

The Bean Libary is a Python based, machine learning and statistical library based on the ANACONDA package. 
It was started because I was getting annoyed at having to programme the same commands again to run simple things like t tests and get the output in a presentable format, as well as having to put blocks of code to do simple machine learning techniques such as kfold regression.

The philosophy of the libary is all code should be done in one line, with as much flexability as possible and to produce a comphensive yet usefull output. 

----------------
### Example

import bean as bn

bn.ttest(x,y)

----------------------------
Independent samples t test:
 T-value= 128.000, p= 0.156 

-------------------------------
More advanced features are available such as OLS, Robust Linear Regression, Cross validation using support vector machines with various kernels as well as linear regression.  

Currently a work in progress.
